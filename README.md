> [Hotwire Native](https://native.hotwired.dev) is the new consolidation of the Turbo Native and Strada libraries into a single framework for iOS and Android. For new development, start with the new [Hotwire Native Android](https://github.com/hotwired/hotwire-native-android) library, which is built on the Turbo Native foundation and offers many new features. For existing Turbo Native apps, please transition to Hotwire Native as soon as possible.
>
> No new features will be added to this library and it will be deprecated in the coming months.

# Strada Android

**[Strada](https://strada.hotwired.dev)** lets you create fully native controls, driven by your web app. It's a set of libraries that work across your [web](https://github.com/hotwired/strada-web), [iOS](https://github.com/hotwired/strada-ios), and Android apps to help you build features that make your [Turbo Native](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/native) hybrid apps stand out. Turn HTML elements that exist in the WebView into native components and communicate messages across your native and web code.

**Strada Android** enables you to create native components that receive and reply to messages from web components that are present on the page. Native components receive messages to run native code, whether it's to build high fidelity native UI or call platform APIs.

## Features
- **Level up** your [Turbo Native](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/native) hybrid apps with high-fidelity native components, driven by web components.
- **Reuse web components** for your [iOS](https://github.com/hotwired/strada-ios) and Android apps.
- **Communicate with the WebView** and its web components without writing any JavaScript in your app.

## Requirements

1. Android SDK 26+ is required as the `minSdk` in your `build.gradle.kts` file.
1. This library is written entirely in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), and your app should use Kotlin as well. Compatibility with Java is not provided or supported.
1. This library supports [Turbo Native](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/native) hybrid apps.
1. Your web app must be running [strada-web](https://github.com/hotwired/strada-web). The `window.Strada` object is automatically exposed on the loaded WebView page, which enables `strada-android` to work.

**Note:** You should understand how Strada works in the browser before attempting to use Strada Android. See the [Strada documentation](https://strada.hotwired.dev) for details.

## Getting Started
The best way to get started with Strada Android is to try out the Turbo Android demo app first to get familiar with the framework and what it offers. The demo app provides several Strada component examples. To run the demo, clone the [turbo-android](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-android) repo, and read the [instructions](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-android/tree/main/demo#readme).
